This widget encapsulates the [OpenLayers 3] (http://openlayers.org/) library for easy use in Yii 2.

# Installation
---------------

## Composer
This is the preferred way of installing the widget. Just add `sibilino/yii2-openlayers` to the `composer.json` file of your Yii 2 application and perform a Composer Update as usual.
```json
"require": {
	"sibilino/yii2-openlayers": "*"
}
```

## Manually

If for some reason you cannot or do not want to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/ "Composer"), then you must create the widget folder manually, and then configure your Yii 2 application to autoload the widget classes.

First, create the folder structure `sibilino/yii2-openlayers/widget` inside the `vendor` subfolder of your Yii 2 application.

Then, download the widget .zip file and extract the **contents** of its `widget` subfolder into the folder you created in the previous step.

Next, edit your application's _config_ file (usually `config/main.php` or `config/web.php`) and add the following alias:
```php
[
	//...
	'aliases' => [
		//...
		'@sibilino/yii2/openlayers' => '@vendor/sibilino/yii2-openlayers/widget',
		//...
	],
	//...
]
```

Remember to use the namespace `sibilino\yii2\openlayers` when calling any of the widget's classes:
```php
use sibilino\yii2\openlayers\OpenLayers;
use sibilino\yii2\openlayers\OL;
```

# Usage
--------
In your view, echo the widget method as usual. The options for the OpenLayers Map() can be specified in `mapOptions`.
The widget will automatically publish the OpenLayers library and output the div that will receive the map.

# Configuration
----------------
The widget supports the following configuration options (to be used outside of the mapOptions array):
* `id`: The id for the widget and the generated container div.
* `options`: Array of HTML options for the container div.
* `jsVarName`: The name of the JavaScript variable that will receive the Map object upon construction.
* `scriptPosition`: The position where the widget will register the map generation code (`View::POS_END` by default). Note that the OpenLayers _library_ will always be registered in `View::POS_HEAD`.
* `mapOptions`: The configuration array to be passed to the JavaScript OpenLayers Map() constructor. Its structure and available options are the same that are supported by the [OpenLayers 3 library] (http://openlayers.org/). Some simplifications are supported by the widget, as described in the next section.

# Specifying map options
------------------------
The problem with OpenLayers map options is that they require complex javascript structures. Two approches are available:

1. Manage your configuration in PHP and translate it to javascript.
2. Manage your configuration directly in javascript.

If your map configuration is relatively simple and depends mostly on data structures that already exist in your PHP application, approach #1 will probably be easier. This widget contains the OL class that can facilitate PHP to javascript translation. See below for details.

When your configuration begins getting complex, the OL class begins to show limitations and you must use JsExpressions, which are no longer easy to nest and basically mean you are again writing plain javascript. In this case, approach #2 is probably necessary. This widget provides a javascript module that easily passes your configuration from your file to the created map. See below for details.

## Map options as PHP array
-----------------------
The idea is to define the javascript options for OpenLayers as a PHP array, using `new OL('something')` when the javascript requires `new ol.something()`, and let the widget manage the translation to javascript automatically.

For example:
```php
use sibilino\yii2\openlayers\OpenLayers;
use sibilino\yii2\openlayers\OL;
use yii\web\JsExpression;
//...

echo OpenLayers::widget([
	'id' => 'test',
	'mapOptions' => [
		'layers' => [
			// Easily generate JavaScript "new ol.layer.Tile()" using the OL class
			new OL('layer.Tile', [
				'source' => new OL('source.MapQuest', [
					'layer' => 'sat',
				]),
			]),
		],
		// Using a shortcut, we can skip the OL('View' ...)
		'view' => [
			// Of course, the generated JS can be customized with JsExpression, as usual
			'center' => new JsExpression('ol.proj.transform([37.41, 8.82], "EPSG:4326", "EPSG:3857")'),
			'zoom' => 4,
		],
	],
]);?>
```
For configuration details, read the next section.
 
For details and examples on OpenLayers configuration, see [the official OpenLayers 3 documentation] (http://openlayers.org/).

### Simplified mapOptions
-------------------------
#### Passing JavaScript and the OL class
----------------------------------------
Many of the OpenLayers options must be specified by an instance of a JavaScript object under the "ol" namespace. This would traditionally require a JsExpression with a string such as `new ol.layer.Tile()` (for a Tile object), with further complications to pass configuration to the constructed object.
To avoid this cumbersome notation, the OL class can be used. Its constructor accepts a classname, which can include namespace information, and an array of options for the classname's constructor. For example:
```php
$olObject = new OL('source.MapQuest', ['layer' => 'sat']);
``` 
Each OL object behaves as a JsExpression that will generate the JavasCript code to instantiate the specified classname with the options. In the case of the example, the resulting code would be:
```javascript
new ol.source.MapQuest({layer:"sat"})
```
In the end, this allows the PHP configuration array to be created just like the desired JavaScript configuration object, but using `new OL('Something')` whenever `new ol.Something()` is required.
#### Specifying options using shortcut strings
----------------------------------------------
When specifying the `mapOptions['view']` or `mapOptions['layers']` arrays, you can identify the some objects by specifying them with a string, instead of creating the corresponding OL instance.
The options that support such a string shortcut are `mapOptions['view']` and any layer in `mapOptions['layers']`. For example:
```php
'mapOptions' => [
	'layers' => [
		'Tile' => [ // The layer type as a string, no need for new OL('layer.Tile' ...)
			'source' => new OL('source.MapQuest', [
				'layer' => 'sat',
			])
		],
	],
	'view' => [ // The 'view' option does not require new OL('View' ...) either
		'center' => new JsExpression('ol.proj.transform([37.41, 8.82], "EPSG:4326", "EPSG:3857")'),
		'zoom' => 4,
	],
],
```
In addition, whenever a layer has been defined using a type string, the source can _also_ be specified using a type string. For example:
```php
'mapOptions' => [
	'layers' => [
		// Again no need for OL('ol.source.OSM'), but no configuration can be passed to the OSM object in this case.
		'Tile' => 'OSM',
	],
],
```

## Map options as javascript
----------------------------
The widget publishes a javascript module that is exposed in the global scope as `sibilino.olwidget`. Options for the creation of the map with id `mapId` can be specified as an object in the `sibilino.olwidget.mapOptions` array, associated with the `mapId` key. For example:
```js
sibilino.olwidget.mapOptions[mapId] = {
    layers: [
    	new ol.layer.Vector({...})
    ]
}
```
Make sure that your javascript code that tries to access the module is inserted *after* the module script.
